# AngularExamples

Repository of some angularjs examples for my own reference and edification while learning angularjs.

These examples require installation of bower components at the level of the project.

To install bower and these components you need to install Node.js to get npm. Then run the following commands from the level of the repo:
* npm install -g bower (this one doesn't need to be at the project level)
* bower install bootstrap
* bower install angular
